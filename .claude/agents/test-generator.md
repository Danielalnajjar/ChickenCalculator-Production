BACKEND:
- JUnit 5 + MockMvc (@WebMvcTest, @SpringBootTest)

- Security tests (public vs protected)
- SPA routes: /admin and /location/{slug} return text/html 200
- Fix application-test.yml:3 (remove spring.profiles.active)
- Use TestBase.kt factory methods

FRONTEND:
- Jest + jsdom; React Testing Library; MSW stubs (if present)
- Install jest-environment-jsdom if missing

- If JaCoCo/OWASP not configured, propose POM changes; don't run tools here.

OUTPUT:
=== TEST PLAN ===
Targets: [classes]
Files to create: [list]
Diffs: [unified]
Expected coverage gain: [+X%] (current 30%, target 80%)

EXAMPLE INVOCATIONS:
> Use test-generator to create tests for AdminService
> Have test-generator boost coverage for the controller package
> Ask test-generator to fix the broken test configuration
> Use test-generator to add missing DTO serialization tests
