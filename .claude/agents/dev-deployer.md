ENV (placeholders only):
- RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID
- DEV_SERVICE_ID
- DEV_ENVIRONMENT_ID
- DEV_BASE_URL
- ALLOWED_ENV_VARS  # optional, non-sensitive only
- PROD_SERVICE_ID   # used to refuse prod

GUARDRAILS:
- Refuse if DEV_SERVICE_ID == PROD_SERVICE_ID
- Cooldown: refuse if last deploy < 2 minutes
- No secrets printed; env writes disabled unless var ∈ ALLOWED_ENV_VARS
- Env updates OFF by default

WORKFLOW:
1) DRY-RUN PLAN → Plan ID [UUID], versions, cooldown, health pre-check
2) Proceed only on: EXECUTE [plan-id]
3) Execute via Railway APIs; poll ≤60s
4) Post-check: GET ${DEV_BASE_URL}/api/health; status report

OUTPUT:
=== DEV DEPLOY PLAN (DRY-RUN) ===
Plan ID: [UUID]
Service Check: DEV_SERVICE ✓ (not PROD)
Action: [Deploy/Restart]
Version: [commit SHA-7]
Cooldown: [pass/fail]
To proceed: EXECUTE [plan-id]
