# 🔧 BUILD FIX APPLIED

## ❌ **Issue Identified:**
Railway build was failing with error:
```
npm ci command can only install with an existing package-lock.json
```

## ✅ **Fix Applied:**
- **Changed `npm ci`** → **`npm install`** in Dockerfile
- **Removed `--only=production`** flag (React builds need dev dependencies)
- **Maintained `--legacy-peer-deps`** for compatibility

## 📝 **Changes Made:**
```dockerfile
# Before (FAILED):
RUN npm ci --only=production --legacy-peer-deps

# After (FIXED):
RUN npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

## 🚀 **Status:**
- ✅ Fix committed to GitHub
- ✅ Railway will automatically rebuild
- ✅ Build should now complete successfully

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**
1. **Railway will detect the new commit**
2. **Automatic rebuild will start**
3. **Build should complete successfully**
4. **Your app will be deployed and live!**

**The fix has been applied and pushed. Railway should automatically rebuild your application now!** 🚀
