# ChickenCalculator Production Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Requirements ✅

All critical issues from the Production Readiness Report have been resolved.

## Environment Variables to Configure in Railway

```bash
# CRITICAL - Must be set before deployment
JWT_SECRET=<generate-secure-32-char-string>  # Use: openssl rand -base64 48
ADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=<secure-password>     # Initial admin password
SENTRY_DSN=<your-sentry-dsn>                # From sentry.io project settings

# Database (if using external PostgreSQL)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database

# Optional Performance Tuning
DB_POOL_SIZE=5                              # Connection pool size (default: 5)
DB_MIN_IDLE=2                                # Minimum idle connections
DB_LEAK_THRESHOLD=60000                      # Connection leak detection (ms)
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Generate Secure Secrets
```bash
# Generate JWT Secret (minimum 32 characters)
openssl rand -base64 48

# Generate Admin Password (must meet complexity requirements)
# - At least 8 characters
# - Contains uppercase, lowercase, and numbers
```

### 2. Configure Railway Environment
1. Go to Railway project settings
2. Add environment variables listed above
3. Verify `PORT=8080` is set (Railway default)
4. Set `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=production`

### 3. Deploy to Production
```bash
# Push to GitHub (triggers Railway auto-deploy)
git push origin main

# Monitor deployment in Railway dashboard
# Check build logs for any errors
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### ✅ Health Checks
- [ ] `/api/health` returns UP status
- [ ] `/actuator/health` shows component health
- [ ] Database connection verified

### ✅ Security Verification
- [ ] Admin login requires password change on first use
- [ ] CSRF tokens working (check browser DevTools)
- [ ] JWT stored in httpOnly cookies (not sessionStorage)
- [ ] H2 console inaccessible (`/h2-console` returns 403)

### ✅ Monitoring
- [ ] `/actuator/prometheus` accessible
- [ ] Metrics being collected
- [ ] Sentry receiving error reports (trigger test error)
- [ ] Correlation IDs in response headers

### ✅ Multi-Tenant Functionality
- [ ] Create test location via admin portal
- [ ] Access location via slug URL
- [ ] Verify data isolation between locations
- [ ] Test sales data and marination logs per location

### ✅ Accessibility & Mobile
- [ ] Mobile navigation hamburger menu works
- [ ] Forms have proper ARIA labels
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG standards
- [ ] Touch targets are 44px minimum

### ✅ API Versioning
- [ ] `/api/v1/*` endpoints working
- [ ] Legacy `/api/*` endpoints still functional
- [ ] Frontend using new versioned endpoints

## Monitoring Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose | Access |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `/api/health` | Basic health check | Public |
| `/actuator/health` | Detailed health | Public |
| `/actuator/prometheus` | Prometheus metrics | Public |
| `/actuator/metrics` | JSON metrics | Public |
| `/api/v1/admin/stats` | Dashboard stats | Admin only |

## First Admin Login

1. Navigate to `/admin`
2. Login with `admin@yourcompany.com` and configured password
3. **You will be forced to change password**
4. Set new secure password
5. Access admin dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start
- Verify `JWT_SECRET` is set (minimum 32 characters)
- Check database connection string
- Review Railway build logs

### Login Issues
- Clear browser cookies
- Verify CSRF token in network tab
- Check correlation ID in logs

### Data Not Isolated
- Verify X-Location-Id header is sent
- Check location exists in database
- Review SalesDataService logs

### Metrics Not Available
- Verify actuator endpoints enabled
- Check SecurityConfig allows public access
- Ensure Prometheus endpoint path is correct

## Performance Baseline

Expected metrics after deployment:
- Response time p95: < 200ms
- Database pool usage: < 50%
- Memory usage: < 512MB
- Error rate: < 0.1%

## Support

- Railway logs: Available in Railway dashboard
- Sentry errors: Real-time error tracking
- Correlation IDs: Use for debugging specific requests
- Metrics: Monitor via Prometheus/Grafana

## Next Steps

1. Set up monitoring dashboard (Grafana)
2. Configure alerting rules
3. Document operational procedures
4. Schedule security review
5. Plan load testing
